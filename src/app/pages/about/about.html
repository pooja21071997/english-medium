          Greetings from Vivekanand Pratisthan English Medium School! It gives me great pride to

          strong Indian cultural values and encourage participation in sports and extracurricular

        <p class="reveal">
          We, at Vivekians, work on the overall development of the child since we ardently believe
          in the holistic development of our learners… in mind, body and spirit… beyond the
          acquisition of knowledge and the scoring of grades. I consider it not just my duty but
          also my passion to provide all Vivekians with opportunities to be on such a path.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          We focus on developing essential 21st-century skills such as critical thinking,
          creativity, problem-solving, and digital literacy—ensuring our students are well prepared
          for the rapidly evolving global world. Our educational approach is aligned with the
          National Education Policy (NEP), promoting independent thinking, innovation, and a
          multidisciplinary learning experience.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          Our impressive academic results in past years are a testimony to the hard work teachers
          are putting in to ensure our children excel and learn in a conducive, supportive and
          motivating environment.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          We see our school parents as equal partners in this endeavor and encourage them to engage
          excitedly in their child’s journey here in close collaboration with teachers.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          It gives me immense pleasure to lead a school that nurtures young minds, builds strong
          character, and empowers students to become confident, responsible citizens of tomorrow.
          Our dedicated team of teachers work relentlessly to provide a balanced education that
          combines values with innovation, tradition with technology and discipline with freedom.
